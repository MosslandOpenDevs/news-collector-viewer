# React Simplified FSD Standards

## Layer Model

- Use `app`, `pages`, `features`, and `shared` as the only top-level layers
- Keep dependency direction as `app -> pages -> features -> shared`
- Import only from lower layers when crossing layer boundaries
- Treat `shared` as reusable foundation code for all higher layers

## Slice Layout

- Create one slice per route under `pages/`
- Create one slice per user capability under `features/`
- Keep each `pages/*` and `features/*` slice structured with `ui/`, `lib/`, and `styles/`
- Add segment folders only when the segment has real code
- Keep app bootstrap, router, providers, and global setup under `app/`

## Segment Ownership

- Place React components and composition logic in `ui/`
- Place business logic, hooks, API clients, and mappers in `lib/`
- Place slice-scoped style files in `styles/`
- Place global constants and localization settings in `shared/config/`
- Place cross-feature utilities and shared types in `shared/lib/`

## Public API Contract

- Create `index.ts` in every `pages/*` and `features/*` slice
- Export stable entry points only from each `index.ts`
- Import slices through `@/pages/<slice>` or `@/features/<slice>` only
- Avoid deep imports such as `@/features/<slice>/ui/<Component>`
- Allow deep imports only for internal files in the same slice

## Shared Layer Rules

- Keep `shared` free of business-specific behavior
- Split shared code into `shared/ui`, `shared/lib`, `shared/config`, and `shared/styles`
- Move duplicated UI and utilities from multiple slices into `shared`
- Prevent `shared` from importing `features`, `pages`, or `app`

## Path and Validation

- Configure `@` alias to the source root before enforcing import rules
- Run checks that detect upward imports and same-layer cross-imports
- Verify each route-facing page is exported through `pages/<slice>/index.ts`
- Verify each feature consumed by pages is exported through `features/<slice>/index.ts`
- Review changed files for layer and segment boundary violations before merging

## Example Structure

- Use the tree below as the baseline for new React projects
- Mirror route names in `pages` slice names
- Mirror user capability names in `features` slice names
